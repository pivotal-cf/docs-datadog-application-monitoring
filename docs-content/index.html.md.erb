This documentation describes Datadog Application Monitoring for VMware Tanzu. Datadog Application Monitoring enables VMware Tanzu users to monitor the health and performance of their applications.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Datadog Application Monitoring for VMware Tanzu is made up of three components:

* DogstatsD
* Trace Agent
* Puppy Agent

DogstatsD is the easiest way to get your custom application metrics into Datadog. It is a metrics aggregation service that implements the StatsD protocol and adds a few Datadog-specific extensions. For more information, see [our documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/DogStatsD/). Additionally, we have [a list of DogStatsD libraries](https://docs.datadoghq.com/libraries/) you can reference to find one that is compatible with your application.

Trace Agent is a service that collects application traces from various sources and forwards them to Datadog. For more information, see [our documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/).

Puppy Agent is a smaller version of the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) that can forward metrics and logs to Datadog. For more information about log-collection, see [our documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/). When enabled, all the logs from stdout and stderr are collect and forwarded by TCP to the Puppy Agent by default.
